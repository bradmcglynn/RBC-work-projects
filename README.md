# RBC-work-projects - WIP
Edited versions of work projects at my current RBC co-op - personal info/ business info removed


Project 1: Unlocated member search - Python (Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter)

Filters through most recent member .csv file in order to find invalid addresses (indicating the member is unlocated). Compiles list of member IDs, then searches through 5+ years of previous member information in order to find their original address as well as the month + year that the address was "lost"/ last known. Function exports several .csv files depending on which category the member falls into, plus two "master files" of all of the located members and all of the remaining unlocated members (remaining unknown members indicate that they do no have an address in our system).

Project 2: T4A Scraper - Python (Selenium, Pandas, NumPy)

Project 3: Obituary Name Comparison Script (Pandas, Numpy)

Project 4: Obituary Scraping Project (Selenium, Pandas, NumPy)

Project 5: Implementation Timeline Automation - R (openxlsx, DataCombine, pracma, rlist, lubridate)
