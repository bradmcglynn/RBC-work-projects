# RBC-work-projects - WIP
Edited versions of work projects at my current RBC co-op - personal info/ business info removed

Project 1: Unlocated member search - Python (Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter)

Filters through most recent member .csv file in order to find invalid addresses (indicating the member is unlocated). Compiles list of member IDs, then searches through 5+ years of previous member information in order to find their original address as well as the month + year that the address was "lost"/ last known. Function exports several .csv files depending on which category the member falls into, plus two "master files" of all of the located members and all of the remaining unlocated members (remaining unknown members indicate that they do no have an address in our system).

Project 2: T4A Scraper - Python (Selenium, Pandas, NumPy)
Aims to search out and download specific tax forms for certain group annuuitant members

Project 3: Obituary Scraping Project (Selenium, Pandas, NumPy)
Scrapes obituary from third party website using Selenium to find key HTML elements, creating a dataframe (turned into a csv file) for further analysis in other scripts

Project 4: Obituary Name Comparison Script (Pandas, Numpy)
Compares names from previously scraped obituary data to current names of annuitant memebers, looking for matches in Full Name, City, Province and COuntry. COmpiles list of matches into a csv file for further analysis.

Project 5: Implementation Timeline Automation - R (openxlsx, DataCombine, pracma, rlist, lubridate)
Transforms an excel sheet sourced from an alternate team into a more useable format for our line of business' project management website Wrike, adding additional responsibilites for certain lists of team memebers depending on data in the sheet

Project 6: Monthly Dashboards (Excel / Tableau): Working on getting an example version over to Github in the near future, currently cannot show this work atm but I am willing to screenshare to show examples of it provided I'm on a company laptop
